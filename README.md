### Jobs and Salaries in Data Science Project


Welcome to my first data analysis project. In this project I analyzed salaries in data science from 2020 - 2023. 
I used ***SQL*** for the data manipulation, and ***Power BI*** for the visualization.
Please feel free to give me feedback and point out areas of improvement. I am always looking to further develop my analytical and data manipulation skills. 


The dataset comes from Kaggle, called 'Jobs and Salaries in Data Science'. I will be analyzing this dataset to get insights on the job market. 
This can be useful for employers and hiring managers. By understanding salary trends and driving factors, businesses can attract and keep top talent by offering competitive compensation packages. It can also be helpful for individuals starting their data career - helping them plan their career paths with informed decisions. 


##### Data Analysis

There was not a lot of cleaning to be done with this dataset. I decided to query this database using SQL for further analysis. We will answer 7 questions:

1. Salary Trends - how have salaries in the data field changed over time?
2. Role Analysis - What are the average salaries for different job categories?
3. Geographical Differences - How do salaries vary by country?
4. Company Size - Does the size of the company affect the salary?
5. Employment type - How does employment type (Full time, Part-time, Freelance) affect salary?
6. Work Setting - Does the work setting impact salary?
7. Experience level - How does the salary change with different experience levels?

These questions will serve as an initial exploration into the dataset. Let's get started:

## 1. Salary Trends

•	2020: $71,248.25

•	2021: $69,370.13

•	2022: $81,981.96

•	2023: $94,233.02

**Mid-Level**


•	2020: $95,578.72

•	2021: $92,640.92

•	2022: $104,652.44

Our dataset shows a consistent upward trend in salaries across all experience level from 2020 to 2023. This goes along with the rapidly increase of data. The data and IT fields have experienced significant growth in salaries over the last years. This is also because of high demand, rapid industry growth, and the importance of data-related roles within companies. 

## 2. Role Analysis

**Entry Level (Avg. Salary):**


- Machine Learning & AI: $225,000
- Data Engineering: $220,000
- Data Science & Research: $220,000
- Data Management & Strategy: $240,000

**Mid Level (Avg. Salary):**


- Data Analysis: $430,967
- Machine Learning & AI: $423,000
- Data Science & Research: $405,000
- Leadership & Management: $430,640


**Senior Level (Avg. Salary):**


- Data Analysis: $385,000
- Data Engineering: $385,000
- Machine Learning & AI: $392,000
- Data Science & Research: $412,000
- Leadership & Management: $405,000


**Executive Level (Avg. Salary):**


- Data Science & Research: $416,000
- Data Engineering: $333,500
- Machine Learning & AI: $330,000
- Leadership & Management: $329,500
- Data Science & Research: $375,500

Data Science and Research consistenly ranks as the highest paying category, with averages exceeding $400,000 for senior and executive roles. This suggests high demand and specialized skillsets. Machine Learning and AI are next, with salaries passing $200,000 - indicating its increasing importance and widespread applications. There also seems to be a wider salary range within certain categories, indicating variations based on job title and company factors. 


## 3. Geographical Differences

- United States: $158,159 (8132 jobs)
- Canada: $143,919 (226 jobs)
- Australia: $132,283 (24 jobs)
- Germany: $91,101 (72 jobs)
- France: $80,338 (50 jobs)
- United Kingdom: $104,447 (449 jobs)
- Netherlands: $76,969 (21 jobs)
- Spain: $55,929 (113 jobs)
- Brazil: $58,569 (17 jobs)
- Portugal: $49,787 (24 jobs)

United States has an average salary of $158,159 with 8,132 jobs, remaining as the dominant market for data scientists. Canada follows behind, with $143,919 and 226 job openings. 
The data suggests a correlation between salary and availability, with larger markets like US and Canada offering higher averages and more opportunities. However, European countries, while having lower averages, might offer better work-life balance and other benefits that attract talent. 
Emerging markets like Brazil and Portugal have potential entry points for data scientists looking for lower living costs and growth potential. 

## 4. Company size 

Small sized companies have an average salary of $90,643 for data roles, with 159 job openings. Large sized companies have a $141,097 average with 748 jobs, and medium sized companies offer the highest average of $152,237 with 8,448 job listings.
It is evident that the size of the company dos have an impact on the average salary. However, it contradicts the initial hypothesis that larger companies would offer higher salaries. There can be a number of factors, and further analysis and data gathering is required. Also, while medium-sized have a higher average, the difference isn't as significant as one would expect. The number of jobs would also skew these results. 


## 5. Employment Type

Type of employment also has an impact on the salary. Full time positions offer the highest average of $150,630, followed by contract with $117,109, part-time with $57,886, and freelance with $53,869. However, the number of job postings could also be giving us the wrong idea of the dataset. There were 9,310 full-time roles, while only 15 part time roles. This means that we would need to gather more data on part time, freelance, and contract employment to be able to compare them to full time. 

## 6. Work Setting

In-person roles have the highest average salary at $155,524, followed by remote at $144,996, and hybrid with $88,912. Work setting also impacts the average salary, with in-person being the most rewarding. 

## 7. Experience Level

The data clearly illustrates how experience level has a huge impact on the average salary in the data industry. Entry level roles are at $88,535, while executive positions have an average of $189,463.

## Conclusion

I used SQL to perform data analysis for the first time with this project. It helped me understand how to ask questions about the data and how to use SQL to get the answers. However, it also helped me remember that data analysis is not the tools that we use, but the insights we can get from data. I look forward to any recommendations and advice. I am always looking for ways to improve my analytical skills.  

*It's worth noting that this analysis is based on the provided dataset and may not fully capture the entire range of salaries across different employment types in the data industry. For a more comprehensive understanding, additional data and variables should be considered.*
